# Floobits plugin for Sublime Text 2

## Development status: Really buggy. You don't want to use this yet.

# Installation instructions

* Clone this repository or download and extract a tarball.
* Rename the directory to "Floobits".
* In Sublime Text, go to Preferences -> Browse Packages.
* Drag, copy, or move the Floobits directory into your Packages directory.

If you'd rather create a symlink instead of copy/moving, run something like:

    ln -s ~/code/collab-sublime-text-2 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages/Floobits

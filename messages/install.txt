Before you can use this plugin, you'll need to configure it.

0. If you don't have a Floobits account, you can create one for free (or just sign in with GitHub) at https://floobits.com/

1. Go to Package Settings -> Floobits -> User Settings

2. Add your Floobits username and API secret to the settings json. It should look something like
{
  "username": "myuser",
  "secret": "gii9Ka8aZei3ej1eighu2vi8D"
}
You can find (and reset) your API secret on your user settings page: https://floobits.com/dash/settings/

At that point, you're all set. For a more verbose guide, see https://floobits.com/help/plugins/#sublime-text
